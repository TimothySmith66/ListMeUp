# ListEmUp
Done: A very simple list maker that can delete items too. 
In development currently: database, a good looking UI, days of the week list, multiple lists for various reasons.
Future development ideas: Alarm, side goals and ideas, possible calendar, personal time management system/ thought organizer

Sometimes being prepared is the best way to achieve goals. So I am creating an application that will allow
the User to add and update ideas. This list making app will eventually be able to create dates, associate ideas and items together, create plans over a longer period of time. By doing so will allow the user to track their progress, be notified of events/achievements, and reminded about neglected/ commonly forgotten listItems as well.
